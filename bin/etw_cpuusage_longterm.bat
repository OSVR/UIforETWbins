@rem Can also use "NT Kernel Logger", but that conflicts with UIforETW
@rem Better to use a different kernel logger to let them run in parallel.

@rem isn't set already.

@rem Generate a file name based on the current date and time and put it in
@rem etwtracedir. This is compatible with UIforETW which looks for traces there.
@rem Note: this probably fails in some locales. Sorry.

@rem to update the timeout status.
