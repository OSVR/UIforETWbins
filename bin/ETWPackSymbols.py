This script copies all of the .symcache files referenced by the specified
ETW trace to a specified directory so that they can easily be shared with
other people. The package export option in WPA (File-> Export Package) makes
this functionality mostly obsolete (Export Package puts the .symcache files in
a .wpapk file along with the trace and the current profile) but this script is
retained because it does give additional flexibility and serves as an example.
